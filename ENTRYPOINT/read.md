 docker build -t entrypoint:1.0.0 .
                                                                                                                                 docker run -d entrypoint:1.0.0 yahoo.com

                                                                                                                                 here we can mix both CMD and entrypoint for good results and at docker run only we should run yahoo.com or goggle.com
